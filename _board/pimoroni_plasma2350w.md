An all-in-one, USB-C powered controller for WS2812/Neopixel and APA102/Dotstar addressable LED strips. Now with added wireless connectivity!

Plasma 2350 W is **powered and programmable by USB-C** and, because USB-C is capable of drawing up to 3A of power, that's enough to power a healthy chunk of LEDs. There's a **useful button** that you could use to switch between effects, plus a reset button and an **onboard RGB LED**. We've also popped a **QW/ST connector** on there, to make it super easy to plug in [Qwiic](https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/qwiic) or [STEMMA QT](https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/stemma-qt) breakouts.

The 'W' version comes equipped with a Raspberry Pi RM2 module, which gives it **2.4 GHz** **wireless and Bluetooth connectivity**. Use it to control Plasma 2350 W remotely, hook it up to online APIs or integrate it with your home automation.

You can buy a Plasma 2350 W on its own, or in a kit with a USB-C cable and some super-cool LED stars, so you can get started lighting stuff up right away.

## About RP2350

The RP2350 chip is the Double Quarter Pounder & Fries to the RP2040's Double Cheeseburger and can have one or more RISC-V burgers instead of either of the M33 ARMs, to stretch the metaphor.

In addition to the modern M33 ARM cores, there are sides of: more PIO capability, a variety of low power states for sipping electrons, a whole security system and some sprinklings of specialist digital video circuits to offload DVI/HDMI output.

You can expect a tasty boost in performance - our "real world" MicroPython tests are running up to 2x faster compared to RP2040, and floating point number crunching in C/C++ is up to 20x faster. The extra on-chip RAM will make a big difference when performing memory intensive operations (such as working with higher resolution displays) and even more can be added thanks to external PSRAM support.

RP2350 comes in two flavours - A (standard) and B (all the pins). The B chip has a stonking 48 usable GPIO pins, including 8 ADCs and 24 PWMs, and features on some of our new products.
