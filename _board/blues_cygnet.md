Cygnet is a Feather-compatible STM32-based MCU, and a lower-cost alternative to our popular Swan MCU. Like the Swan, Cygnet is offered in a Feather standard form factor and uses a STM32L4 part while still providing plenty of flash and RAM to run the majority of your Notecard-powered applications.

The board has three independent power options – USB, battery, or line power – and provides a software-switchable 2 Amp regulator for powering external sensors. When operating in its low-power operating mode, the entire Cygnet board draws only 4uA while retaining all of its memory, making it ideal for battery-powered devices.

Cygnet features support for C/C++ and Arduino, and includes a CORTEX Debug connector, enabling the use of debugging frameworks and tooling such as STLink, JLink, OpenOCD, GDB and more. All of which enable both native and custom integrations into advanced development environments such as Visual Studio Code, IAR, and STM32CUBEIDE.
