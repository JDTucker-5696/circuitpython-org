The nRF7002 DK is the development kit for the [nRF7002](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/nRF7002), and [nRF7001](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/nRF7001) Wi-Fi 6 Companion ICs. It contains everything needed to get started developing on a single board. The DK features an [nRF5340 ](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/nRF5340)multiprotocol System-on-Chip (SoC) as a host processor for the nRF7002.

The DK supports the development of low-power [Wi-Fi](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Wireless/WiFi) applications and enables Wi-Fi 6 features like OFDMA, Beamforming, and Target Wake Time.

The nRF7002 is a Wi-Fi 6 companion IC, providing seamless connectivity and Wi-Fi-based locationing (SSID sniffing of local Wi-Fi hubs). It is designed to be used alongside Nordic’s existing nRF52® and nRF53® Series Bluetooth Systems-on-Chip (SoCs), and nRF91® Series cellular IoT Systems-in-Package (SiPs). The nRF7002 can also be used in conjunction with non-Nordic host devices.

To communicate with the host, SPI or QSPI can be used, and an extra coexistence feature allows for seamless coexistence with other protocols like Bluetooth, Thread, or Zigbee. The nRF7002 is integrated and supported in Nordic’s nRF Connect SDK and the nRF7002 Dk can also be used to emulate the nRF7001.

The nRF7002 is the first device in Nordic’s portfolio of unique Wi-Fi products that will combine seamlessly with Nordic’s existing ultra-low power technologies. Nordic bring their decades of ultra-low-power wireless IoT and silicon design expertise to Wi-Fi. Wi-Fi 6 brings added benefits to IoT applications, including further efficiency gains supporting long-life, battery-powered Wi-Fi operation.

With Wi-Fi 6, Nordic supports all wireless protocols used in Matter, Bluetooth LE for commissioning, Thread for low-power mesh, and Wi-Fi for high-throughput. Matter is a protocol championed by Apple, Amazon, Google, Nordic Semiconductor, Samsung, and hundreds of other companies in consumer IoT.
