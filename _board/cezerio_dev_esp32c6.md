cezerio dev ESP32C6 based on ESP32-C6FH4 SoC from Espressif, RISC-V single-core processor, 4 MB flash memory, and a diverse selection of wireless connectivity options: 2.4 GHz WiFi 6, BluetoothÂ® 5.3, Zigbee 3.0 and Thread 1.3 (802.15.4). Moreover, Wi-Fi 6's Target Wake Time (TWT) technology effectively reduces device power consumption, extending battery life and ensuring long-lasting device performance.

The footprint is Feather-compatible. I2C connector seamlessly integrates the vast ecosystem of sensors, actuators, and more.

This development board also includes a LiPo battery charger, 6-axis IMU (3-axis Accelerometer & 3-axis Gyroscope), 5x5 RGB LED matrix, an addressable RGB LED and more.

For primary power and programming, the board is also equipped with a USB-C connector and a 2-pin JST connector for a LiPo battery.

The ESP32-C6 includes 20 GPIO pins with a wide range of peripheral options including SPI, UART, I2C, I2S, LED PWM, USB Serial/JTAG controller, ADC and more.
