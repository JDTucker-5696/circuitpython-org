This CrowPanel ESP32 4.2” E-paper HMI display adopts advanced active matrix electrophoretic display technology and is equipped with a hard-coated anti-glare surface, which can keep the content clearly visible even in the sun, perfectly reproducing the appearance and reading experience of traditional paper. The built-in ESP32-S3 chip as the main control ensures powerful performance and fast and stable data transmission through the SPI interface. With a high resolution of 400*300, it provides a delicate display effect and adopts a classic black and white dual-color display to adapt to various application scenarios. It is also equipped with multiple interface and button designs, including TF card slot, BAT interface, UART0 interface, 2x10 pin GPIO interface, back button, home button and rotary switch switch, which is convenient for users to develop and operate. The white acrylic shell is not only beautiful but also protects the screen.

Based on the ESP32 chip, another highlight is its wide compatibility. It is compatible with three development environments: Arduino IDE, ESP IDF, and MicroPython, simplifying the secondary development process. Also, its ultra-wide viewing angle design allows you to enjoy the same brilliant image from any angle. The ultra-low power consumption feature consumes only a small amount of power when refreshing, ensuring long-lasting battery life. Pure reflection mode means no backlight is required, and information remains clearly visible after power failure, without worrying about information loss.

Due to its excellent characteristics such as low power consumption, high contrast and high reflectivity, this e-ink screen is widely used in shelf labels, price tags, badges, smart labels, smart home devices, e-readers, smart wearable devices and other portable devices, and is an ideal choice for various smart devices and applications.
