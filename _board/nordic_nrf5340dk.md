The nRF5340 DK is the development kit for the [nRF5340 System-on-Chip (SoC)](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/nRF5340), containing everything needed to get started with development, on a single board.

The DK supports development with an extensive range of wireless protocols. It supports Bluetooth Low Energy with features such as high-throughput 2 Mbps, Advertising Extensions and Long Range. Mesh protocols like Bluetooth mesh, Thread and Zigbee can run concurrently with Bluetooth Low Energy, enabling smartphones to provision, commission, configure and control mesh nodes, which is a prerequisite for [matter ](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Technologies/Matter)applications. It also supports NFC, ANT, 802.15.4 and 2.4 GHz proprietary protocols.

The DK is bundled with an NFC antenna that quickly enables testing of nRF5340â€™s NFC-A tag functionality. A SEGGER J-Link debugger is on the board, enabling full-blown programming and debugging, of both the nRF5340 SoC and external targets.

All analog and digital interfaces, and GPIOs are available via headers and edge connectors. The kit is Arduino Uno Rev3 hardware compatible, meaning it can be easily interfaced with external device shields.

Four buttons and four LEDs simplify input and output to and from the nRF5340 SoC, and are all user-programmable. An on-board external memory is connected to the 96 MHz QSPI peripheral in the nRF5340 SoC.

The nRF5340 DK is typically powered via USB, but can be powered by a wide range of sources, within the supply range of 1.7 to 5.0 V. In addition to USB, it can be powered with external source, but also includes a CR2032 battery holder and a Li-Po battery connector, for in-field testing. Current consumption can be measured by using the dedicated current measurement pins, for example by using Nordic's [Power Profiler Kit II](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/Power-Profiler-Kit-2).

The [nRF Connect SDK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-software/nRF-Connect-SDK) is the software development kit for the nRF5340 SoC, and it has board support for the nRF5340 DK. It supports software development of Bluetooth Low Energy, Thread and Zigbee applications. It integrates the Zephyr RTOS, protocol stacks, samples, hardware drivers and much more.
