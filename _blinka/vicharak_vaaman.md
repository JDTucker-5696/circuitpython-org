**Vaaman** combines the flexibility of an FPGA with the power of an ARM processor to create something truly unique: a re-configurable computer that adapts to your needs. While traditional computers struggle with the increasing demands of realtime processing and AI workloads, Vaaman takes a different approach. By integrating a powerful six-core ARM processor with an Efinix Trion T20 FPGA with 112k LEs, weâ€™ve created a platform that can dynamically reconfigure itself for optimal performance across diverse computing tasks.
