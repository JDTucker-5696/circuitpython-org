Compute Module 5 IO Board

The Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 IO Board provides a starting point for those wishing to integrate Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 into products, while also serving as an alternative Raspberry Pi form factor for industrial applications. It breaks out the full set of peripheral interfaces provided by Compute Module 5 to the standard connectors used by Raspberry Pi 5 (with full-size HDMI in place of micro-HDMI), enabling design engineers to take full advantage of the processing and interfacing capabilities of our flagship modular product.

- 160 mm × 90 mm form factor
- Standard 40-pin GPIO header
- Gigabit Ethernet RJ45 with PoE+ HAT+ support
- 2 × USB 3 sockets
- microSD card socket for CM5 Lite modules
- M.2 M key PCIe socket
- 4-pin fan connector
- 2 × MIPI DSI/CSI-2 FPC connectors (22-pin 0.5 mm pitch cable)
- Raspberry Pi HAT+ connector
- RTC battery socket
- 2 × full-size HDMI 2.0 connectors
- External +5V USB-C PSU
- Power button to wake and shut down Compute Module 5
